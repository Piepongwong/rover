  <h1>Example Code - Rover Assignment </h1>
  <p>I've written 3 different versions for this assignment. Ranging from basic to more advanced: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>app.js</li>
    <li>appNoConstructors.js</li>
    <li>appNoMethods.js</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>App.js is the most advanced. It includes the bonus exercises and uses constructors and methods. appNoConstructors.js is using methods, but no contructors. appNoMethods.js is neither using constructors nor methods. app.js is the best solution because it prevents code repetition and groups functions nicely with the data they influence with methods. Undo de comments to try out the different versions.</p>
